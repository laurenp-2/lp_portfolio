# portfolio
An interactive portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills. Built with React.js. 

To run the project locally: 
  git clone https://github.com/laurenp-2/portfolio.git
  cd lp_portfolio
  pnpm dev

I am constantly revising and updating this site; currently, I am working on implementing a dark mode and expanding my projects section. Come back soon to see any new features!
